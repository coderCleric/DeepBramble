    "OKALIS: Oh my goodness! I was hiding behind one of the trees on the upper ring, and observed one of the campsite occupants return!": "奥卡利斯：天哪！我躲在上层环的一棵树后面，看到营地的一个居住者回来了！",
    "NESIA: Did they see you as well? If they did, then how did they react?": "妮西亚：他们也看到你了吗？如果看到了，他们有什么反应？",
    "OKALIS: They did not notice me at first. However, when I moved out from behind the tree to try and make contact, they turned toward me before fleeing. Notably, they appeared to swim through the air using the webbing on their hands and feet!": "奥卡利斯：起初他们没有注意到我。但当我从树后走出来试图接触时，他们转向我然后逃走了。值得注意的是，他们似乎用手脚上的蹼在空中游泳！",
    "NESIA: Very interesting, especially given your note that they did not appear to have eyes. Did they seem to have any obvious reason for returning?": "妮西亚：非常有趣，尤其是你提到他们似乎没有眼睛。他们返回营地有什么明显的原因吗？",
    "OKALIS: Actually, they appeared to be looking for something. I believe that they found it just before I showed myself, but dropped it as they left. It appears to be some sort of painted tablet. Perhaps I should attempt to return it to them?": "奥卡利斯：实际上，他们似乎在找什么东西。我觉得在我现身之前他们找到了，但离开时掉了。那似乎是一块彩绘的石板。也许我应该尝试还给他们？",
    "AZOLLA: While we had previously decided that it was best to not initiate contact, the fact that they did not attack you seems to indicate they are not hostile. Because of this, it may be best for you to return the item.": "阿佐拉：虽然我们之前决定最好不要主动接触，但他们没有攻击你，似乎表明他们没有敌意。因此，你最好把物品还给他们。",
    "OKALIS: Absolutely! With any luck, I'll be able to get close enough to them to get a better idea of their appearance!": "奥卡利斯：当然！运气好的话，我还能靠近他们，更好地了解他们的外貌！",
    "AZOLLA: Okalis, you were explicitly instructed <![CDATA[<i>]]>not<![CDATA[</i>]]> to attempt to interact with them! What if they had attacked you!": "阿佐拉：奥卡利斯，我们明确指示过你不要试图与他们互动！如果他们攻击你怎么办！",
    "OKALIS: I know, I know, but I was simply too curious to <![CDATA[<i>]]>not<![CDATA[</i>]]> try and see the other species. We are Nomai after all.": "奥卡利斯：我知道，我知道，但我实在太好奇了，忍不住想看看其他物种。毕竟我们是挪麦人。",
    "SENNETTI: Really? What did they look like? Did they seem friendly?": "塞内蒂：真的吗？他们长什么样？看起来友好吗？",
    "OKALIS: Worry not, friend, they did not seem to be hostile. I was fairly far away, so I did not have an ideal view on them. However, I was able to tell they have large, ear-like frills on both sides of their head, a large tail, as well as webbed hands and feet. To top it all off, they seem to have no eyes!": "奥卡利斯：别担心，朋友，他们似乎没有敌意。我离得比较远，所以没能看清他们的样子。不过，我能看到他们头两侧有像耳朵一样的大褶边，一条大尾巴，还有带蹼的手脚。最重要的是，他们似乎没有眼睛！",
    "SENNETTI: How strange! How do you suppose they navigate without vision?": "塞内蒂：真奇怪！你觉得他们怎么在没有视觉的情况下导航？",
    "OKALIS: I am uncertain, but they did seem to notice me when I stepped out from behind the tree. Perhaps they possess some form of echolocation?": "奥卡利斯：我不确定，但当我从树后走出来时，他们似乎注意到了我。也许他们有某种回声定位的能力？",

    "NESIA: Were they appreciative of your attempt to return their item?": "妮西亚：他们对你还物品的尝试表示感激吗？",
    "OKALIS: It went well, yes, and maybe! I avoided hiding this time and, upon returning to the campsite, they slowly approached me, apparently having noticed that I was holding their tablet. I held it out for them to take and, upon grabbing it, they promptly turned around and left.": "奥卡利斯：是的，进展顺利，也许吧！这次我没有躲藏，回到营地时，他们慢慢靠近我，显然注意到我拿着他们的石板。我递给他们，他们一拿到就转身离开了。",
    "OKALIS: As for their appearance, I confirmed what I observed previously. In addition, their teeth seemed to be sharp to a point, their body was covered in gray skin, and they did have small recesses in their skull where eyes might normally reside.": "奥卡利斯：至于他们的外貌，我确认了之前的观察。此外，他们的牙齿似乎很尖，身体覆盖着灰色皮肤，头骨上确实有眼睛通常所在的小凹陷。",
    "AZOLLA: Let us hope that we made a good first impression. They may no longer decide to return now that they have their tablet.": "阿佐拉：希望我们留下了好的第一印象。既然他们拿回了石板，可能不会再回来了。",

    "OKALIS: Perhaps we will be able to meet them if we remain here long enough. If they were here before, they are likely to return.": "奥卡利斯：如果我们在这里待得够久，也许能遇到他们。如果他们之前在这里，很可能会回来。",
    "AZOLLA: As curious as I am about who constructed this site, this may not be wise. We have no idea whether or not the inhabitants of this place are friendly.": "阿佐拉：虽然我对谁建造了这个地方很好奇，但这可能不明智。我们不知道这里的居民是否友好。",
    "SENNETTI: I believe we should avoid constructing large structures here for the same reason. Even if these people are friendly, they may not take kindly to us treating this body as our own.": "塞内蒂：出于同样的原因，我认为我们应该避免在这里建造大型建筑。即使这些人友好，他们也可能不喜欢我们把这里当作自己的地盘。",
    "OKALIS: Amazing! This body is almost entirely covered in grass and trees! How do you suppose it manages to sustain life in a place like this?": "奥卡利斯：太神奇了！这个地方几乎完全被草和树木覆盖！你觉得它是如何在这样的地方维持生命的？",
    "NESIA: We may need to erect a small lab to study the origins of the soil and plant life to properly understand this.": "妮西亚：我们可能需要建一个小实验室来研究土壤和植物的起源，以便更好地理解这一点。",
    "AZOLLA: Feel free to set up that lab, but remember not to build anything large, we don't want to be too obstructive to whoever set up this campsite.": "阿佐拉：尽管建实验室，但记住不要建任何大型建筑，我们不想对建造这个营地的人造成太大阻碍。",

    "NESIA: Oh? Did they seem to have any particular reason for doing so?": "妮西亚：哦？他们这样做有什么特别的原因吗？",
    "OKALIS: As a matter of fact, they led me to somewhere quite interesting. Do you know of the wooden knot that lies in the center of <![CDATA[<color=orange>Briar's Hollow</color>]]>, the one that leads back in through an infinite loop? They took me through there and, contrary to what normally happens, we arrived in an enclosed space.": "奥卡利斯：事实上，他们带我去了一个非常有趣的地方。你知道位于<![CDATA[<color=orange>荆棘空洞</color>]]>中心的那个木结吗？就是那个通过无限循环回到原点的那个？他们带我穿过那里，与平常不同的是，我们到达了一个封闭的空间。",
    "SENNETTI: How strange, what was the space like?": "塞内蒂：真奇怪，那个空间是什么样的？",
    "OKALIS: It seemed to be a completely overgrown entrance to <![CDATA[<color=orange>Briar's Hollow</color>]]>. They beckoned me through another node, although I did not follow them through for fear of being unable to find my way back.": "奥卡利斯：它似乎是<![CDATA[<color=orange>荆棘空洞</color>]]>的一个完全被植被覆盖的入口。他们示意我穿过另一个节点，但我因为担心找不到回去的路而没有跟过去。",
    "AZOLLA: If a member of this other species desires for us to follow them, it may be worthwhile to do so. They have demonstrated they are not hostile, and they may know how to escape from this place.": "阿佐拉：如果这个其他物种的成员希望我们跟随他们，那么这样做可能是值得的。他们已经证明自己没有敌意，而且他们可能知道如何逃离这个地方。",
    "NESIA: I have passed through the knot you speak of, but I have never arrived anywhere that sounds similar to what you describe.": "妮西亚：我穿过你说的那个节点，但从未到达过你描述的那种地方。",
    "OKALIS: It confuses me as well, Nesia. I am unsure of how to access that area again.": "奥卡利斯：这也让我感到困惑，妮西亚。我不确定如何再次进入那个区域。",
    "NESIA: I have a hypothesis. I have noted that the hole one uses to enter that central knot lines up with where they will re-enter this larger area. If we can locate the exterior of the enclosure that you speak of, we may be able to find the hole that will lead us into it.": "妮西亚：我有一个假设。我注意到进入那个中心节点的洞与他们重新进入这个较大区域的位置对齐。如果我们能找到你说的那个封闭空间的外部，我们也许能找到通向它的洞。",
    "I don't understand your strange language, but I hope that you may know mine. Follow where I lead and find us. It may be only a feeling, but I think that our species are fated to meet.": "我不懂你们的奇怪语言，但我希望你们能懂我的。跟随我的引导，找到我们。这可能只是一种感觉，但我认为我们的物种注定要相遇。",
    "OKALIS: Is this our new friend's writing? How exciting! Sennetti, are you able to understand what they have said?": "奥卡利斯：这是我们新朋友的文字吗？太令人兴奋了！塞内蒂，你能理解他们说了什么吗？",
    "SENNETTI: Unfortunately, I will need to analyze it more before I can determine what this text says. Though I can assure you I will begin work on my translation as soon as possible.": "塞内蒂：不幸的是，我需要进一步分析才能确定这段文字的意思。不过我可以向你保证，我会尽快开始翻译工作。",

    //sl_cracked_crystal
    "SENNETTI: During my most recent trip to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye Signal Lab</color>]]> on <![CDATA[<color=orange>Magma's Recursion</color>]]>, I noticed that one of the gravity crystals had fallen from its mount and cracked. Due to the high cost of production for these crystals, it may be worthwhile to develop a means by which they can be repaired. I have brought the crystal here for study.": "塞内蒂：在我最近一次前往<![CDATA[<color=orange>岩浆回响</color>]]>上的<![CDATA[<color=orange>眼信号实验室</color>]]>时，我注意到其中一个重力晶体从支架上掉下来并破裂了。由于这些晶体的生产成本很高，开发一种修复它们的方法可能是值得的。我把这个晶体带到这里进行研究。",
    "NESIA: I would help, but I am currently fully occupied working on the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Distant Node Project</color>]]>. Unfortunately, I suspect this is true for all of us, so it may take some time to develop a means to repair this crystal.": "妮西亚：我愿意帮忙，但我目前正忙于<![CDATA[<color=orange>远程节点项目</color>]]>。不幸的是，我想这对我们所有人来说都是如此，所以开发修复这个晶体的方法可能需要一些时间。",
    "OKALIS: I have good news! It seems our friends may have found a way to repair the gravity crystal! If you are interested in learning more, I suggest making your way to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Concert Hall</color>]]>.": "奥卡利斯：我有好消息！看来我们的朋友可能已经找到了修复重力晶体的方法！如果你有兴趣了解更多，我建议你去<![CDATA[<color=orange>音乐厅</color>]]>。",
    "SENNETTI: I understand. I hope we have time to develop a method of repairs soon, however, as I worry other crystals may also fall.": "塞内蒂：我明白了。不过，我希望我们能尽快开发出修复方法，因为我担心其他晶体也可能掉落。",

    //soil_lab
    "NESIA: Curiously, analysis of the soil composition indicates that this body may be composed of the remnants of many others.": "妮西亚：奇怪的是，土壤成分分析表明，这个天体可能由许多其他天体的残余组成。",
    "SENNETTI: Do you mean to say that this planetoid is composed of debris from planets that ended up in this place after their destruction?": "塞内蒂：你是说这个小行星是由行星毁灭后进入这里的碎片组成的吗？",
    "NESIA: I do. The trees also show characteristics from many cataloged species, which, combined with the unique set of nutrients they draw from the soil, may explain the strange color of the fire in the campsite.": "妮西亚：是的。这些树木还显示出许多已记录物种的特征，再加上它们从土壤中吸收的独特营养，可能解释了营地火焰的奇怪颜色。",
    "SENNETTI: Interesting. So this bramble captures planets, or at least planetary fragments, with such frequency that they are able to congeal into completely new bodies.": "塞内蒂：有趣。所以这个荆棘如此频繁地捕获行星，或者至少是行星碎片，以至于它们能够凝结成全新的天体。",

    //stalking
    "SENNETTI: On my way over here this morning, I felt certain that I saw shapes flitting about in the fog. Has anybody else observed this phenomenon?": "塞内蒂：今天早上我来这里的路上，我确信我看到了一些形状在雾中飘动。还有其他人观察到这种现象吗？",
    "OKALIS: I too have noticed this, friend. They seem to be the same species as the person I made contact with recently. They have been quite bold with me. One was stationed directly outside my window this morning, but ran off as soon as I stirred!": "奥卡利斯：我也注意到了，朋友。他们似乎和我最近接触的那个人是同一物种。他们对我很大胆。今天早上有一个直接站在我的窗外，但一看到我动就跑了！",
    "SENNETTI: What should we do? They do not yet appear hostile, but our stalker's behavior is very concerning.": "塞内蒂：我们该怎么办？他们看起来还没有敌意，但这个跟踪者的行为非常令人担忧。",
    //stalking
    "AZOLLA: I suspect that they will be the ones to make the first move. Remember, stay with one another, and do not behave aggressively.": "阿佐拉：我认为他们会先采取行动。记住，彼此待在一起，不要表现出攻击性。",
    "AZOLLA: I have noticed this as well Sennetti, I believe that our strange neighbors may be keeping an eye on us.": "阿佐拉：我也注意到了，塞内蒂。我觉得那些奇怪的邻居可能在监视我们。",
    "NESIA: I noticed some shapes in the fog when I stepped out of my abode last night as well.": "妮西亚：昨晚我走出住所时，也在雾中看到了一些模糊的身影。",

    //treehouse_recording
    "OKALIS: Is this the place you wanted to show me Amylax?": "奥卡利斯：阿米拉克斯，这就是你想带我看的地方吗？",
    "AMYLAX: Yeah! It's a little place Ditylum and I set up when we were kids. It was our secret hideout whenever things got scary, like when the adults would feed the anglerfish.": "阿米拉克斯：是啊！这是我和迪提伦小时候搭建的小地方。每当事情变得可怕时，比如大人们喂食鮟鱇鱼时，这里就是我们的秘密藏身处。",
    "OKALIS: It feels... meaningful, that you would bring me here, so close to where our species first made contact.": "奥卡利斯：你带我来这里，感觉……很有意义，这里离我们物种初次接触的地方很近。",
    "AMYLAX: Heh, I guess so, huh.": "阿米拉克斯：嘿，我想是的。",
    "OKALIS: I'm really grateful you gave me this necklace. I truly am incapable of expressing how much it means to me.": "奥卡利斯：真的很感谢你送我这串项链。我无法用语言表达它对我有多重要。",
    "AMYLAX: I'm glad that you're glad! Ever since I first met you I've thought that you were really... well... just great all around I guess! I know the necklace you made me isn't super traditional, but you know what, I love it! I think it symbolizes us really well!": "阿米拉克斯：我很高兴你开心！自从我第一次见到你，我就觉得你真的很……嗯……各方面都很棒！我知道你做的项链不太传统，但你知道吗，我超喜欢！我觉得它很好地象征了我们！",
    "OKALIS: Amylax, you are too kind!": "奥卡利斯：阿米拉克斯，你太善良了！",
    "AMYLAX: You know, ever since we became adults, Ditylum kinda stopped coming out here, and, well, this is somewhere that I've shared with you now, so, maybe we could make it our secret hideout? If that sounds okay with you? Sorry, I know that's kind of childish, especially for a big scientist like yourself.": "阿米拉克斯：你知道，自从我们成年后，迪提伦就不怎么来这里了。现在我把这个地方分享给你，也许我们可以把它当作我们的秘密藏身处？如果你觉得可以的话？抱歉，我知道这有点幼稚，尤其是对你这样的大科学家来说。",
    "OKALIS: I don't think it would be childish at all Amylax, and I'd be thrilled to do so! Was there something you had in mind?": "奥卡利斯：我一点也不觉得这幼稚，阿米拉克斯，我很乐意！你有什么想法吗？",
    "AMYLAX: Well, I was thinking that we could write our names on the wall? After all, what's a secret hideout without a mark to let any trespassers know who it belongs to?": "阿米拉克斯：嗯，我在想我们可以在墙上写下我们的名字？毕竟，如果没有标记让闯入者知道这里属于谁，那还叫什么秘密藏身处呢？",
    "OKALIS: I think that is a wonderful idea, Amylax.": "奥卡利斯：我觉得这是个很棒的主意，阿米拉克斯。",

    //camp_hint
    "NESIA: Who is responsible for the campsite on the large planetoid near the center of <![CDATA[<color=orange>Briar's Hollow</color>]]>? It represents an excellent location for us to build more permanent residence, and I am quite shocked that someone is keeping it to themselves.": "妮西亚：谁负责管理<![CDATA[<color=orange>荆棘空洞</color>]]>中心附近的大型小行星上的营地？那是一个非常适合我们建造永久居所的地方，我很惊讶有人把它据为己有。",
    "AZOLLA: I am inclined to believe our friends, Nesia, and I do not believe that any of our clan would be willing to keep such a secret from the group. Are you certain that the campsite you saw could not have been a natural formation?": "阿佐拉：我倾向于相信我们的朋友，妮西亚。我不认为我们族中会有人愿意对大家隐瞒这样的秘密。你确定你看到的营地不是自然形成的吗？",
    "NESIA: I am absolutely certain. There was a small ring of stones with still smoldering firewood inside.": "妮西亚：我完全确定。那里有一个小石环，里面还有未燃尽的木柴。",
    "AZOLLA: Quite an interesting find, Nesia! We should make our way over there and investigate at once. Do you recall where we can find this planetoid?": "阿佐拉：真是个有趣的发现，妮西亚！我们应该立刻过去调查。你还记得在哪里能找到这个小行星吗？",
    "NESIA: I was concerned that I would be unable to find it again, so I planted a signal beacon near the strange campsite.": "妮西亚：我担心找不到它，所以在那个奇怪的营地附近放置了一个信号信标。",
    "AZOLLA: Then we should go there at once. If there are other sentient creatures here, it is imperative that we determine their level of hostility as soon as possible.": "阿佐拉：那我们应该立刻过去。如果这里有其他智慧生物，我们必须尽快确定他们的敌意程度。",
    "SENNETTI: I have been here putting together shelters, I did not realize there were any other bodies out there.": "塞内蒂：我一直在搭建避难所，没注意到外面还有其他天体。",
    "OKALIS: I have investigated the surrounding area some, but I have not yet located this large planetoid that you speak of.": "奥卡利斯：我调查了周围区域，但还没找到你说的大型小行星。",
    "SENNETTI: Is it possible that the campsite was made by other members of our clan? Perhaps they followed us through our makeshift warp setup and are stranded here as well.": "塞内蒂：营地可能是我们族中其他成员搭建的吗？也许他们通过我们的临时跃迁装置跟随我们，也被困在这里了。",
    "NESIA: As much as I would hope for your hypothesis to be true, there were no other structures indicative of Nomai presence, and it has long been outside of our culture to construct campfires.": "妮西亚：虽然我希望你的假设成立，但没有其他结构表明挪麦人的存在，而且建造篝火早已不是我们的文化习惯。",
    "OKALIS: Are you saying that there is a campsite in here that none of us made? That would imply there are other sentient beings here besides us!": "奥卡利斯：你是说这里有一个营地，但不是我们任何人建的？那意味着这里除了我们之外还有其他智慧生物！",

    "NESIA: Unfortunately, this body may simply be too small for any effective structures to be built here.": "妮西亚：不幸的是，这个天体可能太小了，无法在这里建造任何有效的结构。",
    "OKALIS: It may still have some use. For instance, I believe that this rock may be showing us a possible escape!": "奥卡利斯：它可能还有些用处。比如，我觉得这块岩石可能向我们展示了一条逃生路线！",
    "NESIA: I would caution you against raising your hopes, Okalis, we have already seen that this environment is far from easy to navigate.": "妮西亚：我要提醒你不要抱太大希望，奥卡利斯。我们已经看到，这个环境远非易于导航。",
    "SENNETTI: Okalis might be correct! Looking past this wall, I can just barely make out a place where the wooden enclosure seems to end!": "塞内蒂：奥卡利斯可能是对的！透过这堵墙，我勉强能看到一个地方，那里的木质围栏似乎结束了！",
    "AZOLLA: If this is true, we should investigate immediately. Escaping <![CDATA[<color=orange>Briar's Hollow</color>]]> is our first step towards finding the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>.": "阿佐拉：如果这是真的，我们应该立即调查。逃离<![CDATA[<color=orange>荆棘空洞</color>]]>是我们寻找<![CDATA[<color=orange>宇宙之眼</color>]]>的第一步。",

    "OKALIS: Curiously, we all seem to have emerged from the same wooden knot a mere few feet from each other, despite the fact that, when we left, we were quite far apart.": "奥卡利斯：奇怪的是，尽管我们离开时相距甚远，但我们似乎都是从同一个木结中出现的，彼此仅相隔几英尺。",
    "NESIA: Suppose that this place does not obey euclidean laws. What if that wooden sphere is actually the one we found ourselves in, but we were smaller when inside it?": "妮西亚：假设这个地方不遵循欧几里得定律。如果那个木球实际上是我们发现自己所在的地方，但我们在里面时变小了呢？",
    "OKALIS: What an intriguing idea Nesia! Suppose that, instead, these spheres allow travelers to instantaneously teleport between them?": "奥卡利斯：真是个有趣的想法，妮西亚！假设这些球体可以让旅行者在它们之间瞬间传送呢？",
    "NESIA: Hm, assuming what you said to be true, that might explain how we were able to warp earlier. What if this place interfered with our warp? Could it have done the same to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>?": "妮西亚：嗯，假设你说的是真的，那可能解释了我们之前是如何跃迁的。如果这个地方干扰了我们的跃迁呢？它是否也对<![CDATA[<color=orange>飞船</color>]]>产生了同样的影响？",
    "SENNETTI: Friends, while the curiosities of this place intrigue me as well, I believe we should focus on securing our survival first and foremost.": "塞内蒂：朋友们，虽然这个地方的奇特之处也让我着迷，但我认为我们应该首先确保生存。",
    "AZOLLA: Sennetti is right; As much as we may desire to study our environment, our first priority should be to locate oxygen and somewhere to construct shelter.": "阿佐拉：塞内蒂说得对；尽管我们渴望研究环境，但我们的首要任务应该是找到氧气和建造避难所的地方。",
    "OKALIS: I believe that I can see a number of small planetoids over there. Could they be a candidate?": "奥卡利斯：我相信我能看到那边有一些小型小行星。它们可能是候选地吗？",
    "NESIA: I see the objects that Okalis speaks of; there appear to be five small planetoids, and I believe I can see a tree on one.": "妮西亚：我看到了奥卡利斯说的那些物体；似乎有五颗小型小行星，其中一颗上有一棵树。",
    "AZOLLA: That settles it then. The tree will provide us oxygen, and we can set up basic shelter on the planetoids themselves. One of them seems noticeably smaller than the others, so we should use it for building materials.": "阿佐拉：那就这么定了。树会为我们提供氧气，我们可以在小行星上搭建基本避难所。其中一颗明显比其他小，我们可以用它作为建筑材料。",
    "NESIA: Based on what we have seen thus far, it may be worthwhile to establish names for the wooden cavities we find ourselves in. Does anybody have a suggestion for this one? It seems quite spacious.": "妮西亚：根据我们目前所见，为我们所在的木质洞穴命名可能是有价值的。有人对这个地方有建议吗？它似乎相当宽敞。",
    "AZOLLA: We should keep it simple but descriptive. I believe that the name <![CDATA[<color=orange>Briar's Hollow</color>]]> should work well.": "阿佐拉：我们应该保持简单但具有描述性。我认为<![CDATA[<color=orange>荆棘空洞</color>]]>这个名字很合适。",

    "NESIA: Why do you suppose the Dree chose to go through the trouble of taming these fish? I can't imagine that their domestication was something easily achieved.": "妮西亚：为什么你认为德瑞人选择费尽心思驯服这些鱼？我无法想象驯服它们是件容易的事。",
    "AZOLLA: From what we have observed, the eggs of these very fish are the main source that the Dree have for nutrition. Perhaps this is what led them to tame the creatures?": "阿佐拉：根据我们的观察，这些鱼的卵是德瑞人的主要营养来源。也许这就是他们驯服这些生物的原因？",
    "SENNETTI: Perhaps, but I suspect that it had more to do with their proximity. The Dree do not seem to appreciate looming threats, and generally take measures to either move away or neutralize them.": "塞内蒂：也许吧，但我认为这与它们的接近性更有关系。德瑞人似乎不喜欢潜在的威胁，通常会采取措施远离或消除它们。",
    "NESIA: Do you suppose that this may also be why they refuse to spread? They are very localized, and their population is quite low, given how long they've been here.": "妮西亚：你认为这也是他们拒绝扩散的原因吗？他们非常局限，而且考虑到他们在这里的时间，他们的数量相当少。",
    "SENNETTI: It very well could be. They seem much more content to leave things as they are, rather than take risks in the name of more comfortable living conditions.": "塞内蒂：很有可能。他们似乎更满足于维持现状，而不是为了更舒适的生活条件而冒险。",

    "OKALIS: Yes! I wanted to visit here quickly to confirm my suspicions, but I believe that we can use Kevin to cross the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Nursery</color>]]> and retrieve Ditylum.": "奥卡利斯：是的！我想尽快来这里确认我的猜测，但我相信我们可以利用凯文穿过<![CDATA[<color=orange>育婴所</color>]]>，救出迪提伦。",
    "NESIA: An interesting idea! Kevin's teeth are large enough that we should be able to graft handles to them without causing him harm. Then, we could have him carry us across the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Nursery</color>]]>, and none of the juveniles would suspect anything due to his presence!": "妮西亚：有趣的想法！凯文的牙齿足够大，我们可以在不伤害他的情况下安装把手。然后，我们可以让他带我们穿过<![CDATA[<color=orange>育婴所</color>]]>，由于他的存在，幼崽们不会怀疑任何事！",
    "AZOLLA: It sounds as if this will be our plan to rescue Ditylum then. Kevin has proven easy to train in the past, so it should be doable in a reasonable time frame.": "阿佐拉：听起来这就是我们救迪提伦的计划了。凯文过去被证明很容易训练，所以这应该可以在合理的时间内完成。",
    "AZOLLA: I will be glad when this is done. Primarily because it will mean that Ditylum is back to safety, but also it will be recompense for the incident when we first approached <![CDATA[<color=orange>Magma's Recursion</color>]]>.": "阿佐拉：这件事完成后我会很高兴。主要是因为这意味着迪提伦安全了，同时也是对我们第一次接近<![CDATA[<color=orange>岩浆回响</color>]]>时发生的事故的补偿。",
    "SENNETTI: This does sound promising, but how do we get to Kevin without being attacked? Even worse, what do we do if Kevin brings us to the other side, and then wanders away?": "塞内蒂：这听起来很有希望，但我们如何在不被攻击的情况下接近凯文？更糟糕的是，如果凯文把我们带到另一边，然后自己走开了怎么办？",
    "OKALIS: A sensible concern, friend! But remember, the Dree have already trained Kevin to come when hit in the eye with a small object. I am sure that we will be able to construct some sort of launcher to take advantage of this behavior from a distance.": "奥卡利斯：这是个合理的担忧，朋友！但记住，德瑞人已经训练凯文在被小物体击中眼睛时过来。我相信我们可以制造一种发射器，从远处利用这种行为。", //第一段

    //rock_blocking_full
    "OKALIS: How do you suppose this rock achieves its behavior? It appears to move exclusively when it is unobserved.": "奥卡利斯：你觉得这块石头是怎么做到这种行为的？它似乎只在未被观察时移动。",
    "SENNETTI: Perhaps it is some form of macroscopic quantum behavior? It may exist in all locations at the same time, but collapses to a single possibility once observed by a conscious being.": "塞内蒂：也许这是一种宏观量子行为？它可能同时存在于所有位置，但一旦被有意识的生物观察，就会坍缩到单一位置。",
    "OKALIS: An interesting idea! This may indeed be the case, I can think of no other explanation for how it may relocate itself so dramatically.": "奥卡利斯：有趣的想法！确实可能是这样，我想不出其他解释来说明它如何如此剧烈地移动。",
    "AZOLLA: While this is an interesting find, it is a shame that it does not seem to be useful to our current goals. I had hoped that this would help us locate the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye of the Universe</color>]]>.": "阿佐拉：虽然这是个有趣的发现，但遗憾的是它似乎对我们当前的目标没有帮助。我原本希望它能帮我们找到<![CDATA[<color=orange>宇宙之眼</color>]]>。",
    "NESIA: Actually, I believe that I may have accidentally found an additional behavior of this rock. When one of the two main locations is blocked by a small object (such as a scroll or a writing staff), it seems that the rock moves to an additional, third location. I theorize that this is due to the rock having an extremely low probability to appear in that location. However, it is forced into that superposition once the only other possibility is occupied. I have been calling this the Rule of Quantum Probability.": "妮西亚：实际上，我可能无意中发现了这块石头的另一种行为。当两个主要位置之一被小物体（如卷轴或书写工具）挡住时，石头似乎会移动到第三个位置。我推测这是因为石头出现在那个位置的概率极低。然而，当其他可能性被占据时，它被迫进入这种叠加状态。我称之为量子概率法则。",
    "AZOLLA: Even more interesting, but I still fail to understand how this would aid us in reaching the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>.": "阿佐拉：更有趣了，但我仍然不明白这如何帮助我们到达<![CDATA[<color=orange>宇宙之眼</color>]]>。",
    "NESIA: I am still putting together the details (in particular, I want to bring Karenia to observe this phenomenon), but I believe that this may be useful to a proposal of mine that I am calling the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Distant Node Project</color>]]>. I encourage you all to join me here sometime when I have more of the details worked out. I will be able to explain the idea in full then.": "妮西亚：我还在整理细节（特别是我想让卡蕾妮亚来观察这个现象），但我认为这可能对我提出的<![CDATA[<color=orange>远程节点计划</color>]]>有用。等我整理好更多细节后，欢迎大家来和我一起讨论。那时我可以详细解释这个想法。",
    "NESIA: If this is the case, it may hint at the nature of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]> as well. This rock seems to emanate a signal similar to the one reverberating through this area.": "妮西亚：如果是这样，它可能也暗示了<![CDATA[<color=orange>宇宙之眼</color>]]>的本质。这块石头似乎发出了与这个区域回荡的信号相似的信号。",

    //sedentary_fish_lore
    "NESIA: At first I was quite confused how these fish could survive with the stark absence of viable prey, but after observing them, I believe I understand. They live very sedentary lives, only moving to ambush potential prey. This allows them to expend very little energy. In fact, I believe that only ones as large as the mother near the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Translation Lab</color>]]> require larger prey. Smaller ones can simply subside on the smaller creatures that float throughout the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>, digesting anything foolish enough to enter their mouths.": "妮西亚：起初我很困惑这些鱼在没有足够猎物的情况下如何生存，但经过观察后，我想我明白了。它们过着非常懒散的生活，只有在伏击潜在猎物时才会移动。这使得它们消耗的能量非常少。事实上，我认为只有像<![CDATA[<color=orange>翻译实验室</color>]]>附近的那条母鱼那样大的鱼才需要更大的猎物。较小的鱼可以依靠漂浮在<![CDATA[<color=purple>荆棘</color>]]>中的小生物为生，消化任何愚蠢到进入它们口中的东西。",
    "AZOLLA: An interesting idea, Nesia. This would explain why the Dree are able to rely on the anglerfish staying away. There is no need to worry about an encroaching predator when that predator never moves.": "阿佐拉：有趣的想法，妮西亚。这解释了为什么德瑞人可以依赖鮟鱇鱼远离他们。当捕食者从不移动时，就不必担心它们的入侵。",
    "SENNETTI: This may even explain how that anglerfish grew to that size. Perhaps they grow proportionally to their nutritional intake.Thus the extra food the Dree give her has caused her to grow to such an exceedingly massive size.": "塞内蒂：这甚至可能解释了那条鮟鱇鱼是如何长到那么大的。也许它们的生长与营养摄入成正比。因此，德瑞人给她的额外食物使她长到了如此巨大的体型。",

    //stomach_lore
    "NESIA: Interesting. It seems that the majority of the anglerfish's internal volume is taken up by this central cavity, rather than organs.": "妮西亚：有趣。看来鮟鱇鱼的大部分内部空间被这个中央腔占据，而不是器官。",
    "OKALIS: But how can that be? They seem to be large predators that have evolved to swallow prey whole. How could they have such a small space for their stomach?": "奥卡利斯：但这怎么可能？它们似乎是进化成可以吞下整个猎物的大型捕食者。它们的胃怎么会这么小？",
    "NESIA: I do not believe that they have any stomach at all. Instead, this interior cavity is normally flooded with a free-floating digestive enzyme, allowing the fish to entrap and consume any organic matter that it can fit inside its mouth.": "妮西亚：我认为它们根本没有胃。相反，这个内部腔通常充满了自由漂浮的消化酶，使鱼能够捕获并消化任何能进入其口中的有机物质。",
    "NESIA: Additionally, the fact that the enzyme disperses upon petting the eye of the fish is likely not a trained behavior, as it seems unlikely that the Dree would have had any need for such a thing. I believe that, instead, this may allow juvenile fish to brush against the eye of an adult to gain access to their prey.": "妮西亚：此外，酶在抚摸鱼的眼睛时分散的行为可能不是训练出来的，因为德瑞人似乎不需要这样的行为。我认为，这可能让幼鱼通过触碰成年鱼的眼睛来获取猎物。",
    "AZOLLA: Interesting! It's rather odd a species that are normally so territorial can become such social creatures once their young are involved.": "阿佐拉：有趣！通常如此具有领地意识的物种在涉及到幼崽时会变得如此社会化，这真是奇怪。",

    "AZOLLA: Did he mention what the nature of the accident was?": "阿佐拉：他提到事故的性质了吗？",
    "OKALIS: Not in detail. From what I understood, it seems as if two of the juvenile fish got into an altercation, and Kevin hit the wall in the process of separating them. It seems that none of the Dree were present for the altercation, so that is simply their best guess.": "奥卡利斯：没有详细说明。据我所知，似乎是两条幼鱼发生了冲突，凯文在分开它们的过程中撞到了墙。似乎当时没有德瑞人在场，所以这只是他们的猜测。",
    "SENNETTI: It is fortunate that the Dree have him there then, I imagine one of the juvenile fish could have been seriously injured had Kevin not intervened.": "塞内蒂：幸好德瑞人让他待在那里，我想如果凯文没有干预，其中一条幼鱼可能会严重受伤。",
    "NESIA: Are you referring to Kevin? That is unfortunate, I hope it does not leave any permanent effects.": "妮西亚：你是指凯文吗？这很不幸，我希望不会留下永久的影响。",

    "KARENIA: Observant as always! All you need to do is take your cracked crystal, place it in one of the hexagonal slots, and ring the correct bells! Specifically, you need to ring the bell two places left of the crystal, then directly to the right, and finally directly below.": "卡蕾妮亚：一如既往的敏锐！你只需要把破裂的晶体放在一个六边形槽中，然后敲击正确的钟！具体来说，你需要敲击晶体左侧两个位置的钟，然后直接敲击右侧的钟，最后敲击正下方的钟。",
    "OKALIS: That seems fairly simple! Does it matter what slot the crystal is placed in, or do any work?": "奥卡利斯：这似乎很简单！晶体放在哪个槽中有关系吗？还是随便放都可以？",
    "KARENIA: Any slots should work, as long as you're able to ring the correct bells.": "卡蕾妮亚：只要你能敲击正确的钟，任何槽都可以。",
    "AZOLLA: I'm quite impressed with your ability to find a repair method so quickly. It never occurred to me that harmonics could be used as a viable method!": "阿佐拉：你这么快就找到修复方法，让我印象深刻。我从未想过谐波可以作为一种可行的方法！",
    "KARENIA: Thanks! Music is very important to us, so we're always excited when we hear a problem that it might solve. I should clarify though that this method is only able to repair minor damage, like cracks. If part of the crystal is outright missing then it won't work.": "卡蕾妮亚：谢谢！音乐对我们非常重要，所以当我们听到它可能解决的问题时，总是很兴奋。不过我要澄清一下，这种方法只能修复轻微的损坏，比如裂缝。如果晶体的一部分完全缺失，那么它就不起作用了。",

While this has been changing some, I was curious what brought about this attitude in the first place?": "奥卡利斯：阿米拉克斯，我们注意到的一件事是，尤其是在最近的事件之后，你们的人似乎对环境的接受度有点过高。虽然这种情况有所改变，但我很好奇最初是什么导致了这种态度？",
    "AMYLAX: It's an artifact from when things weren't so peaceful, before we had tamed the anglerfish and things like that. As I'm sure you're all aware, the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]> is not exactly safe, and there was a time where death was pretty commonplace. During that time, we learned that taking tragedy in stride would be more or less necessary for our survival.": "阿米拉克斯：这是在我们驯服鮟鱇鱼之前，事情并不那么和平的时代的遗留物。正如你们所知，<![CDATA[<color=purple>荆棘</color>]]>并不完全安全，曾经有一段时间死亡非常普遍。在那段时间里，我们学会了从容面对悲剧，这对我们的生存来说是必要的。",
    "AZOLLA: I see. I fear we Nomai may suffer from the opposite problem as you Dree. I am sure you have noticed our species' eagerness to explore. It is one of our greatest prides, but it can also lead to some rash decision making.

    "NESIA: We Nomai are defined by our nomadic lifestyle and inquisitive nature. Because of this, our species put a high priority on the development of advanced technology that would allow us to travel to faraway places. You Dree, on the other hand, had to contend with the hostile environment of the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>, so you focused on developments that facilitated your survival. This led to several impressive developments, chief among them your ability to commune with the plant on a level we Nomai have never observed in all of our travels.": "妮西亚：我们挪麦人以游牧生活方式和好奇心著称。因此，我们物种高度重视发展先进技术，使我们能够前往遥远的地方。而你们德瑞人则必须应对<![CDATA[<color=purple>荆棘</color>]]>的恶劣环境，因此你们专注于促进生存的发展。这导致了一些令人印象深刻的发展，其中最重要的是你们与植物交流的能力，这是我们在所有旅行中从未见过的。",

    "NESIA: It is a byproduct of our nomadic lifestyle. Traditionally, Nomai clans are constantly moving from place to place, so writing out and recording our conversations became our way of sharing knowledge with others. If at some point another clan were to stumble upon somewhere we had been, they would find our writing and have a head start on understanding their surroundings.": "妮西亚：这是我们游牧生活方式的副产品。传统上，挪麦氏族不断从一个地方迁移到另一个地方，因此写下和记录我们的对话成为我们与他人分享知识的方式。如果某个时候另一个氏族偶然发现我们曾经到过的地方，他们会找到我们的文字，并更快地理解他们的环境。",

    "NESIA: In particular, by struggling to understand him, you were ultimately successful, allowing your relationship to move forward. I hypothesize this will continue to be the case for the both of you, repeatedly struggling to come to an understanding, doing so, and moving forward together because of it. To be honest, it sounds similar to my relationship with Secca.": "妮西亚：特别是，通过努力理解他，你最终成功了，使你们的关系得以发展。我推测你们会继续这样，反复努力达成理解，并因此一起前进。说实话，这听起来很像我和塞卡的关系。",
    "OKALIS: How so?": "奥卡利斯：怎么说？",
    "NESIA: Secca and I had many moments where we struggled to come to an understanding. At the start of our relationship, we both thought ourselves quite clever, and it took some time to realize our interpretation of the other's words and actions were not always correct. Over time, we learned to do better, and to struggle to understand each other, as you and Amylax are doing. It took conscious effort to do so, but the mere fact that you came for advice shows you are already committing that effort.": "妮西亚：塞卡和我有很多次努力达成理解的时刻。在我们关系的初期，我们都认为自己很聪明，花了一些时间才意识到我们对彼此言行解读并不总是正确的。随着时间的推移，我们学会了做得更好，并努力理解彼此，就像你和阿米拉克斯正在做的那样。这需要刻意的努力，但你来寻求建议的事实表明你已经在付出这种努力了。",

    "OKALIS: I cannot help but wonder how they first started stealing those eggs. The anglerfish hardly seem like the kind of beasts you would want to approach.": "奥卡利斯：我忍不住想知道他们最初是如何开始偷那些卵的。鮟鱇鱼似乎不是你愿意接近的那种野兽。",
    "SENNETTI: Actually, one of the language samples I analyzed during my translation is an old story that seeks to explain exactly that. As the story goes, they had found a massive anglerfish keeping watch over a clutch of eggs. The ancient aliens were starving, as they had failed to find food for days, and began devising a plan to steal the eggs.": "塞内蒂：实际上，我在翻译过程中分析的一个语言样本是一个试图解释这一点的古老故事。故事是这样的，他们发现了一条巨大的鮟鱇鱼守护着一窝卵。古代外星人因为几天找不到食物而饿得不行，于是开始策划偷卵的计划。",
    "SENNETTI: They ultimately decided to distract the mother with a massive rock that was in the vicinity, hoping that slamming it into a nearby wall would lure the mother away for long enough to grab a few of the eggs and flee under pursuit. However, when the mother reached the rock, she did not turn around and pursue the thieves. Instead, she sank her teeth into the rock and stayed there, drifting with it. This distracted the fish long enough for the aliens to take as many eggs as they wanted. Supposedly, the fish was still latched onto the rock as they left.": "塞内蒂：他们最终决定用附近的一块大石头分散母鱼的注意力，希望将石头撞到附近的墙上能引诱母鱼离开足够长的时间，以便抓取一些卵并在追逐下逃跑。然而，当母鱼到达石头时，它并没有转身追逐小偷。相反，它咬住石头并留在那里，随石头漂流。这分散了鱼的注意力足够长的时间，让外星人拿走了他们想要的尽可能多的卵。据说，当他们离开时，鱼仍然咬在石头上。",
    "NESIA: What an interesting tale! Why do you suppose the mother behaved like that? Are the fish unable to distinguish between organic and inorganic prey?": "妮西亚：多么有趣的故事！你认为母鱼为什么会那样做？鱼无法区分有机和无机的猎物吗？",
    "OKALIS: An interesting hypothesis, Nesia! I would love to test it, if it were not for the fact our friends would likely not appreciate us feeding rocks to their fish.": "奥卡利斯：一个有趣的假设，妮西亚！如果不是因为我们的朋友可能不喜欢我们给他们的鱼喂石头，我很想测试一下。",

    "OKALIS: It is a lovely necklace, woven from several small vines which seem to have been made to grow around one another. I am honestly unsure how he must have made it. Perhaps he used the druidic influence his people seem to have? Whatever the case, it must have taken some time to create.": "奥卡利斯：这是一条可爱的项链，由几根小藤蔓编织而成，这些小藤蔓似乎被设计成相互缠绕生长。老实说，我不确定他是怎么做到的。也许他利用了他们族人所拥有的德鲁伊能力？无论如何，制作它一定花了不少时间。",
    "SENNETTI: Hm, yes, I suspected that might be the case. Okalis, I feel I should inform you that, based on my studies of these alien's culture, a necklace such as that is a key component of the traditional courting ritual. Usually, the intended recipient will either refuse the necklace, indicating a lack of interest, or accept it and gift the initiator with a similar necklace.": "塞内蒂：嗯，是的，我怀疑可能是这样。奥卡利斯，我觉得我应该告诉你，根据我对这些外星文化的研究，这样的项链是传统求偶仪式的关键组成部分。通常，预期的接受者要么拒绝项链，表示缺乏兴趣，要么接受它并回赠发起者一条类似的项链。",
    "OKALIS: Are you certain? A courting ritual?! That would imply... was Amylax asking me to be his partner!?! How do I properly respond to that!?": "奥卡利斯：你确定吗？求偶仪式？！那意味着...阿米拉克斯是在请求我成为他的伴侣吗！？！我该如何正确回应！？",
    "SENNETTI: Well, I would guess by either refusing or accepting the offer. Which one you choose is up to you, though I would strongly suggest you make a decision soon. I suspect that you have left Amylax quite confused.": "塞内蒂：嗯，我猜要么拒绝，要么接受这个提议。选择哪一个取决于你，不过我强烈建议你尽快做出决定。我怀疑你已经让阿米拉克斯相当困惑了。",
    "OKALIS: Refuse or accept... If that is the case, then Sennetti, would you be willing to help me gain a better understanding of his language? I believe I have a message important enough that it must be written by hand.": "奥卡利斯：拒绝或接受...如果是这样的话，塞内蒂，你愿意帮助我更好地理解他的语言吗？我相信我有一个足够重要的信息，必须手写。",

I stated I took it as a \"surefire token of the continued friendship between ourselves and our species\" He extended an offer of partnership and I, for all intents and purposes, called him a very good friend!

    "NESIA: I believe I may have found a suitable location for this lab. On another island, I found a cave leading down. It leads into an area filled with gas, but I believe the upper area may be cool enough for our equipment to function correctly given the assistance of environmental regulation.": "妮西亚：我相信我可能已经找到了一个适合这个实验室的地点。在另一个岛屿上，我发现了一个向下的洞穴。它通向一个充满气体的区域，但我相信在环境调节的帮助下，上层区域可能足够凉爽，使我们的设备能够正常运行。",
